        <h2>Our Love Story 💗</h2>
        <p>We started this beautiful journey on <strong>26th August</strong>, and since then, you've been my world. My heart beats a little faster every time I hear your name. You are my happiness, my reason to smile, and my Khargosh 🐇.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, I unknowingly do things that hurt you, and I never mean to. You have the most luxurious part of my heart. No matter what happens, one thing is always true – I love you, more than you love Kashmir, more than you love yourself 💗.</p>
